# MacyMae
A Java-based clone of the worlds most iconic video game.  This is a learning project dreamed up as a first step in game programming (something I should be able to complete in relatively little time); not the first game I started working on, but hopefully the first I finish.

PLay as Macy-Mae, the baddest (and hungriest) fat cat on the block, as she evades dogs and tries to eat all the food.
