# MacyMae
A Java-based clone of the worlds most iconic video game.  This is a learning project dreamed up as a first step in game programming (something I should be able to complete in relatively little time); not the first game I started working on, but hopefully the first I finish.

Play as Macy-Mae, the baddest (and hungriest) fat cat on the block, as she evades willow-wisps and tries to eat all the food.

This will probably never be officially release as (1) its an obvious rip-off, (2) I've realized how bad the graphics will probably look with a cat (unless I just use a cat head), and (3) respect for the original.  But, its a good warm-up for writing other games and a good way to learn more about Git and GitHub at the same time, and practice for writing good, clean code (which Doomlike Dungeons is not).
