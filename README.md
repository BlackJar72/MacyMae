# Macy Mae's Eating Adventure

A Java-based clone of the worlds most iconic video game.  Play as Macy Mae, the baddest (and hungriest) fat cat on the block, as she evades willow-wisps and tries to eat all the food.  (BTW, Macy Mae is not a fictional character, she's a real cat that belonged to a neighbor of mine -- just in completely fantastic setting.)

Playable binaries are available for Linux and Windows (requires Java 7 or newer).

Macy Mae's Eating Adventure started out using LWJGL, but now uses pure java, and so no extra libraries are needed and the file size is smaller.
