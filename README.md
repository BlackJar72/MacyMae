# MacyMae
A Java-based clone of the worlds most iconic video game.  Play as Macy Mae, the baddest (and hungriest) fat cat on the block, as she evades willow-wisps and tries to eat all the food.  (BTW, Macy Mae is not a fictional character, she's a real cat that belonged to a neighbor of mine -- just in completely fantastic setting.)

Playable binaries are available for Linux and Windows (requires Java 7 or newer).

Windows: http://www.mediafire.com/download/txkaxvgbgumilvy/MacyMae.exe

Linux: http://www.mediafire.com/download/548xlhb8mknn32l/MacyMae.sh.tar.gz

Java Jar (requires LWJGL, not included, to run): http://www.mediafire.com/download/jmicr1jyp85efba/MacyMae.jar

Future updates may add:
* Bonus edibles (some coding done)
* Sound possibly, though I find (dispite comon wisdom) this is just as fun as similar games without it
* More mazes (maze switching has been in the code a long time, just that the full list currently has only one)

Again, maybe -- I'm think of this as done, except for possible bug-fixes on for the Windows version.  There is no plan to add side tunnels, as the maze is bigger than most similar games, and I like it without them.  I have debated an Android port as a future learning problem as I begin to learn Adroid programming, but also very maybe.
