/**
 * This is a simple Pac-Man clone named in honor of a neighbors cat, a fat cat
 * that always seemed to be hungry and would eat almost anything.  The goal is
 * to imitate the game play while using completely different graphics and maps
 * (thus to avoid copyright issues). 
 * 
 * This is also largely a practice / learning project, and intended to be 
 * finished quickly at least in part to see if I can do it as quickly and easily
 * as I have imagined in Java (i.e., this is not intended as a commercial game
 * and will likely be free, unlike other game writing projects I plan to come
 * up with).  This will likely use LWJGL, even though swing / AWT would probably
 * suffice.
